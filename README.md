This repository consists of two main parts:
* Playground for standard library implementation of threads - ```<thread>```
and the implementation of Message Passing Interface - ```MPICH```.
* Simple comparison of producer consumer scheme using different number of
working threads and libraries.

To make life easier simple C++ wrapper around archaic C API was created.
